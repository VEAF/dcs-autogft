# DCS-BAJAS
Birger And Jens' Asset Script for DCS mission making

### How to use in your mission
1. Add a mission start trigger
2. Add the script to the trigger

## Ground reinforcements
Allows the mission maker to define some zones where AI ground units will battle each other. When either side takes casualties, it will reinforce the combat zone.

### How
1. Add at least three trigger zones: Red spawn, blue spawn and combat zone
2. Use a script to specify the reinforcement setup
